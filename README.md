language-on-my-os
=================

Markdown instructions on how to build a development environment "X" on operating system "Y".

Suggested Directory Structure
=============================

Create a directory with the same name as the language you're adding instructions for. EX: `Haskell`.

Inside that directory create another directory for you OS. EX: `OS X`

In the OS directory create and README.md file containing your instructions. If you'd like add a script to the directory for bootstrapping the language.
